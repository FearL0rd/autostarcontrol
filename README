Meade Autostar control app

Author: Paul Burton <paulburton89@gmail.com>

This app controls the mount using it's AUX port, connected to the PC
via an mbed microcontroller running code to translate the commands sent
to it via serial/USB to the Autostar's I2C-ish protocol, and return the
responses if applicable. It should be fairly trivial to adapt it to use
something other than the mbed (eg. the actual Meade #506 cable) but I
have no plans to do so.
